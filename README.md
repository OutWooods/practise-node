# Practise Node
The past two day's I've been using Node to work with my bowling challenge, which is a single page web app. 
I found it really helpful to build a sandbox project to try out Jest and Puppeteer (have a look if you want.)
So I've decided to do more sandboxes to practise Testing with JS. 

This one is more a sandbox to try out/refresh/practise different testing frameworks. So I'll build a basic application, and then shift between different test systems. 
Its primarily a learning tool, but I found cloning other peoples learning repo's quite helpful so I thought I'd put mine up too.
